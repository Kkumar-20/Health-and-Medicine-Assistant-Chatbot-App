Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthy.Diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients tothe body. Such nutrients provide the body with energy and keep it running. Nutrients help build and strengthenbones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e., blood pressure).
